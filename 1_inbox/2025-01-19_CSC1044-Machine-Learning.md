## Definition
![[Pasted image 20250119162407.png]]
ML is a subset of AI, allows machines to learn and imporve from exprience
without explicit programming, using algorithms that can recognize patterns, 
make predictions and optimze decision-making based on data.
## Overview

## Types of ML
1. [[2025-01-19_Supervised-(classification,-regression)|Supervised (classification, regression)]]

2. [[2025-01-19_Unsupervised-(clustering,-association)|Unsupervised (clustering, association)]]

3. Semi-Supervised (supervised + unsupervised)

## ML Life cycle

1. Collect data
2. Prepare data
3. Choose a model
4. Train a model
5. Parameter tuning
6. Evaluation & testing
7. Deployment & forecasting
