# Critique of "Redefining 'Possible' with Computing" in the Context of Computability  

## 1. "Possible" in the Context of Computability  

In the formal study of **computability**, the term **"possible"** has a precise and absolute meaning:  
- A problem is **possible** to solve if there exists an **algorithm** (or Turing machine) that produces a solution in a **finite amount of time**.  
- If no such algorithm exists, the problem is considered **impossible** to solve, making it **undecidable**.  

### **Key Points**:  
1. **Limits of Computability**:  
   - Certain problems are **provably undecidable**. For example:  
     - The **Halting Problem**: Determining whether a program halts or runs forever on a given input is undecidable.  
   - Such problems cannot be solved **no matter how advanced the technology** becomes, because they lie **outside the boundaries of computation**.

2. **Ambiguity of "Redefining Possible"**:  
   - The phrase "Redefining Possible" might imply that computing can solve **any problem** given sufficient advancement.  
   - However, computability theory sets **absolute boundaries**:  
     - What is **impossible** (undecidable) remains impossible, regardless of technological progress.

## 2. How Future Technologies Could Impact This Phrase  

While computability theory defines **hard limits**, future technologies could impact what is "possible" in a **practical sense**:

### 1. **Efficiency and Complexity**  
- Problems that are computable but currently **intractable** (e.g., requiring exponential time) might become **practically solvable**.  
- Advances such as:  
   - **Quantum Computing**: Capable of solving specific problems (e.g., prime factorization via Shor's algorithm) exponentially faster than classical computers.  
   - **Algorithmic Innovations**: Breakthroughs in algorithms could reduce complexity, making previously infeasible problems solvable.  

**Example**: NP-hard problems like the **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)** are solvable in principle but require too much time. New technologies could provide faster approximations or solutions.

### 2. **Approximation and Heuristics**  
- Even if exact solutions remain infeasible, **approximate solutions** or heuristics can make problems practically solvable.  
   - Example: Machine learning techniques approximate solutions to problems like image recognition, which are computationally expensive.

---

### 3. **Physical Constraints and Models of Computation**  
- Future technologies may push boundaries by exploring alternative computational models:  
   - **Quantum Computing**: Explores non-classical states to compute solutions.  
   - **DNA Computing** and **Brain-Inspired Computing**: Leverage physical or biological systems for computation.  
- However, these technologies still cannot solve **undecidable problems**, as they adhere to the same fundamental limits of computation.

---

## 3. Conclusion  

- In the strict context of **computability theory**, the phrase *"Redefining 'Possible'"* has limits, as certain problems are provably **impossible to compute**.  
- However, in a **practical context**, future advancements in computing (e.g., quantum computing, new algorithms, and heuristics) can redefine what is **feasible and efficient**, expanding what is "possible" within the realm of computable problems.  

Thus, while technology can improve **efficiency** and **practical problem-solving**, it cannot overcome the **absolute limits** of computability.
