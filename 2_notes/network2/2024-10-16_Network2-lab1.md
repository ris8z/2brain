# 4.6.1 Properties of Wireless Media

- **Wireless Media**: Allows devices to connect to the physical layer using electromagnetic signals (radio or microwave frequencies) to transmit binary data.
- **Mobility**: Wireless media offers the greatest mobility options, making it the primary way users connect to home and enterprise networks.
  
### Limitations of Wireless Media:
1. **Coverage Area**: 
   - Works well in open environments.
   - Limited by construction materials and local terrain.
   
2. **Interference**: 
   - Susceptible to disruption by cordless phones, fluorescent lights, microwave ovens, and other wireless devices.
   
3. **Security**:
   - Wireless communication doesnâ€™t require physical access to the network medium.
   - This can lead to unauthorized access and security concerns, making network security crucial for wireless networks.
   
4. **Shared Medium**: 
   - Wireless LANs (WLANs) operate in half-duplex mode, meaning only one device can send or receive at a time.
   - Multiple users can result in reduced bandwidth for each device.

- **Other Media**: Despite the growth of wireless for desktop connectivity, copper and fiber are still the most common physical layer media for intermediary devices like routers and switches.

# 4.6.2 Types of Wireless Media

Wireless data communication standards cover both the **data link** and **physical layers** and include the following key areas:
- **Data to radio signal encoding**
- **Transmission frequency and power**
- **Signal reception and decoding**
- **Antenna design and construction**

### Key Wireless Standards:
1. **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)**:
   - Wireless LAN (WLAN) technology commonly known as **Wi-Fi**.
   - Uses **CSMA/CA** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance) protocol: Wireless NIC listens before transmitting to ensure the channel is clear.
   - Wi-Fi is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance and is based on IEEE 802.11 standards.

2. **Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15)**:
   - Known as **Bluetooth** and used for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN).
   - Operates over distances from 1 to 100 meters using a device pairing process.

3. **WiMAX (IEEE 802.16)**:
   - Known as **Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)**.
   - Uses a **point-to-multipoint** topology to provide wireless broadband access.

4. **Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)**:
   - Used for low-data-rate, low-power communications in **short-range** environments.
   - Ideal for applications like wireless light switches and IoT devices.
   - Zigbee focuses on long battery life and low data rates, typically used in industrial and IoT environments.

> **Note**: Cellular and satellite communications are also wireless technologies but are outside the scope of this module.

# 4.6.3 Wireless LAN

### Common Wireless LAN (WLAN) Implementation:
- Devices connect wirelessly via a LAN using specific network devices.

### Required WLAN Devices:
1. **Wireless Access Point (AP)**:
   - Concentrates wireless signals from users.
   - Connects to the existing copper-based network infrastructure (e.g., Ethernet).
   - Home wireless routers often integrate a router, switch, and access point in one device.

2. **Wireless NIC Adapters**:
   - Enable network hosts to communicate wirelessly.

### WLAN Standards:
- A number of WLAN Ethernet-based standards have been developed.
- Ensure compatibility and interoperability when purchasing wireless devices.

### Benefits of Wireless Data Communications:
- **Cost Savings**: Eliminates the need for costly premises wiring.
- **Mobility**: Allows greater flexibility for devices to move within the network.
  
> **Important**: Network administrators must develop robust security policies to protect WLANs from unauthorized access and security breaches.

## Qustions answers:

1. The correct answer is False. Wireless provides the greatest mobility of all media and is gaining popularity in enterprise networks.
2. The correct answer is False. WLANs operate in half-duplex, which means only one device can send or receive at a time. This can impact network performance if there are many users accessing the WLAN at the same time.
3. Zigbee is intended for applications that require short-range, low data-rates, and long battery life, making it well suited for industrial and IoT applications.
4. This wireless standard is used for Personal Area Networks (PANs) and allows devices to communicate over distances of 1 to 100 meters.
