# Cisco IOS Concepts

## Operating Systems (OS) in Network Devices
- **End devices and network devices** require an OS to function.
- Users interact with the OS via the **shell** using either a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** or a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.
- **CLI-based network programs** are controlled by entering commands using a keyboard, and output is displayed on a monitor.

## Cisco IOS Command Modes
Cisco IOS devices operate with two primary command modes:

1. **User EXEC Mode**
   - **Limited access mode**, used primarily for basic operations.
   - Prompt ends with a `>` symbol.
   - Users cannot make configuration changes in this mode.

2. **Privileged EXEC Mode**
   - **Higher access mode** allowing advanced commands, including configuration changes.
   - Accessed using the `enable` command.
   - Prompt ends with a `#` symbol.
   - From here, the user can access **global configuration mode**.

## Global Configuration Mode and Subconfiguration Modes
- **Global configuration mode** is used for device-wide configuration.
  - Accessed by using `configure terminal` in privileged EXEC mode.
  - To exit back to privileged EXEC mode, use the `exit` command.
- Two common subconfiguration modes:
  1. **Line Configuration Mode**: Used to configure settings on **virtual terminals** or **console lines**.
  2. **Interface Configuration Mode**: Used to configure specific network interfaces (like Ethernet, VLAN).

## Cisco IOS Help System
- **Context-sensitive help**: Provides information about available commands based on the current mode.
- **Command syntax check**: Helps identify incorrect command usage by displaying errors.

## Device Hostname and Password Configuration
- The **first configuration command** should be to assign a **hostname** to the device.
- Devices must have **passwords** configured to limit administrative access.
- Passwords can be **encrypted** and categorized into different privilege levels (e.g., user EXEC vs privileged EXEC).
- **Banners** can be added to display security messages (e.g., unauthorized access warnings).

## Startup and Running Configuration Files
- Two main configuration files:
  1. **Startup-config**: Stored in **NVRAM**, loaded when the device boots.
  2. **Running-config**: Stored in **RAM**, reflects the current operating state and is active immediately after changes. If not saved, changes are lost after a reboot.

## IP Address Configuration
- Devices use **IP addresses** to communicate over the internet.
- **IPv4 addresses** are written in **dotted decimal notation** (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- IP addresses can be configured manually or automatically using **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**.
  - **DHCP** dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices.

## Switch Virtual Interface (SVI)
- To manage a switch remotely, it must have an IP address assigned to an **SVI**.
- The default SVI on Cisco switches is **VLAN1**.

## Verification Commands
- **show ip interface brief**: Verifies the status of switch interfaces and addresses.
- **ping**: Tests connectivity to another device or network.

> [!TIP]
>  NVRAM vs. RAM:
NVRAM: Data is retained when the device is powered off. Used to store configuration data, such as the startup-config on Cisco devices.
RAM: Data is lost when the device is powered off. Used for temporary data storage, like the running-config on Cisco devices, which reflects the current configuration in use.

# Questions and Answers

### Question 1:  
Which statement is true about the running configuration file in a Cisco IOS device?  
- **Answer**: It affects the operation of the device immediately when modified.  
- **Explanation**: The running configuration is stored in RAM and any changes take effect immediately.

### Question 2:  
Which two statements are true regarding the user EXEC mode?  
- **Answer**: 
  - The device prompt for this mode ends with the '>' symbol.
  - Only some aspects of the router configuration can be viewed.
- **Explanation**: User EXEC mode offers limited access to view basic information but does not allow full configuration changes.

### Question 3:  
Which type of access is secured on a Cisco router or switch with the enable secret command?  
- **Answer**: Privileged EXEC  
- **Explanation**: The `enable secret` command secures access to the privileged EXEC mode, where advanced commands can be executed.

### Question 4:  
What is the default SVI on a Cisco switch?  
- **Answer**: VLAN1  
- **Explanation**: Cisco switches have VLAN1 as the default SVI used for management access.

### Question 5:  
When a hostname is configured through the Cisco CLI, which three naming conventions are part of the guidelines?  
- **Answer**: 
  - The hostname should be fewer than 64 characters in length.
  - The hostname should contain no spaces.
  - The hostname should begin with a letter.
- **Explanation**: These guidelines help ensure proper naming conventions for device hostnames in Cisco networks.

### Question 6:  
What is the function of the shell in an OS?  
- **Answer**: It interfaces between the users and the kernel.  
- **Explanation**: The shell provides an interface for users to interact with the underlying kernel, which manages the system hardware.

### Question 7:  
A router with a valid operating system contains a configuration file stored in NVRAM. The configuration file has an enable secret password but no console password. When the router boots up, which mode will display?  
- **Answer**: User EXEC mode  
- **Explanation**: Without a console password, the device boots into user EXEC mode, which has limited access.

### Question 8:  
An administrator has just changed the IP address of an interface on an IOS device. What else must be done in order to apply those changes to the device?  
- **Answer**: Nothing must be done. Changes to the configuration on an IOS device take effect as soon as the command is typed correctly and the Enter key has been pressed.  
- **Explanation**: Changes to the running configuration are applied immediately after the command is executed.

### Question 9:  
Which memory location on a Cisco router or switch will lose all content when the device is restarted?  
- **Answer**: RAM  
- **Explanation**: RAM stores the running configuration and is cleared when the device is restarted.

### Question 10:  
Why would a technician enter the command copy startup-config running-config?  
- **Answer**: To copy an existing configuration into RAM  
- **Explanation**: This command copies the startup configuration from NVRAM into the running configuration in RAM.

### Question 11:  
Which functionality is provided by DHCP?  
- **Answer**: Automatic assignment of an IP address to each host  
- **Explanation**: DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses to network devices, eliminating the need for manual configuration.

### Question 12:  
Which two functions are provided to users by the context-sensitive help feature of the Cisco IOS CLI?  
- **Answer**: 
  - Displaying a list of all available commands within the current mode.
  - Determining which option, keyword, or argument is available for the entered command.
- **Explanation**: The context-sensitive help system provides real-time assistance based on the user's current command input.

### Question 13:  
Which memory location on a Cisco router or switch stores the startup configuration file?  
- **Answer**: NVRAM  
- **Explanation**: NVRAM stores the startup configuration, which is loaded when the device boots.

### Question 14:  
To what subnet does the IP address 10.1.100.50 belong if a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0 is used?  
- **Answer**: 10.1.0.0  
- **Explanation**: With a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0, the network portion is 10.1, so the subnet is 10.1.0.0.
