# leadership_principles

## tips (star)

situation: describe the situation that u wanna talk about
task: elaborate on tha task involved
action: about the specific steps that u took to ensure sucess
result: about the outcome 

## 1 Customer obsession: 

> [!TIP]
> (tell me about the time when u had to deal with a really diffcult customer): tutoring?

Leaders:
- start with the **customer** and work backwards.
- work hard to get and keep **customer trust**
- although pay attation to __competitors__, they obsess with their **customer**,

Questions:
- What  problem are we trying to solve?
- What will customer most care about?
- What would they be most disappointed with?
- What would they love most?

if a competitor build something that customer loves
we should be aware of it, and be inspired to think how
we can imporve our customer experience with that knoladge.

## 2 Ownership:
> [!TIP]
> describe a tough situation in which you had to step into a leadership role/
tell me about a tough decsion you made during a project (project ui/dublin uni?)

Leader:
- are **owners**.
- think long term and don't sacrifice **long-term value** for short-term result.
- **act for the whole company**, beyond just their own team
- never say "that's not my job"

Question:
- What would i do if this were my personal money?

Owners ensure that a problem is owned
and they have a path to resolution, and they
dirve it themself if needed.

## 3 Invent and Simplify
> [!TIP]
> tell me about the time when you solved a compmlex problem, and how you went about doing it/
how do you handle rowblocks or obstaclas (network in the bridge problem?)

Leaders:
- expect and require **innovetion and invention** from their team, and always find ways to **simplify**.
- are externally aware, looks for new idea every where, **not limited by "not invented here"**
- while doing new things, we accept that **may be misunderstood** for long periods of time.

Example:
- aws (pioniring cloud computing)
- alexa (pioniring vocal recognition)

## 4 Are Right,a lot (A proxy for judgment)
> [!TIP]
> tell me about a time where you had to make a decision without much customer data/
tell me about a time when you had to convice team members on something that u proposed
(dirvemate/ inplace for the ui)

Leaders:
- are right a lot
- The have strong **judgment** and good **instincts**.
- The seek **diverse prespectivs** and work to **disconfirm** their belifs.

We are tring to get **the best possible answer for customer**,
whoever's idea it is.

Leader speack less in a room, they are search for opion that can make them change
way of think

## 5 Learn to be curios
> [!TIP]
> tell me about a skill that u recently learnd/ built a process
Leaders:
(web screaping with python?)

- are **never done learning** and always seek to improve themself
- are **curios** to explore new possiblity and act

You have to both have a plan on how u are going to change
and then make that change


## 6 Hire and Develop the best
> [!TIP]
> tell me about the time when you have a conflict with someone, how did you resolve it,
and what did you learn?
(bridge again?)

Leader:
- reaise the performace bar with every hire and promotion.
- recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization.
- devleops leaders and take **coaching others really seruious**.
- work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisims for development like Career Choice


## 7 Inisit on the Highest Standards
> [!TIP]
> tell me about a time when you had to make a decision to make short-term sacrifices for
long term gains/ tell me about a time when u made a decioson based on data and u where ultimly wrong 
(gym?/idk)

Leaders:
- have really **High standars**, 
- are constatly rasing the bar and dirve thir team to deliver high quility product.
- ensure that **defects** do not get sent on the line, and fixed problem **stay fixed**

Higher expectations lead to better results.
Keep fighting that is a fight worth fitigh for.

## 8 Think Big
> [!TIP]
> tell me about your greatest success/ tell me about a time you where creative
(tuor, tutor)

- Thinking small is a self-fullfilling prophecy
- create and communicate bold direction that inspire results
- think differently and **look around corners** for way to serve customers

All of us have to look around corners

## 9 Bias for Action
> [!TIP]
> how have you convinced others to take action?/ How have you managed risk in a project
(show them data?/ a project)

- **Speed matters** in business
- Many decision and actions are **reversable** and do not need extensive study
- We value calculated risk taking.

In pratica se puoi tornare indierto rischia, se no penso un attimono in piu
prim di rischiare letsgooo ez
We live in a world of closing windows
every thing is a race
You can be fast while still having an high standars for the company

## 10 Frugality
> [!TIP]
> tell me about a time your turnd down more resource to complete a project/ tell me about the time you had to
accomplish big result with very little budget
(?)

- **accomplisih more with less**.
- constrains build resourcefulness, self-sufficency and invention.
- there are no extra point for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense

## 11 Earn Trust
> [!TIP]
> an exampele of how you manage conflict or how u earnd the trust of your team members 
(talking?/consisent honest, ..., ?)

- be honest, autentich stright forward
- listeing but challengin respectufully if u disagre
- delivery what u say u would

basic:
- deliver it 
- speak up
- own it
- be self critcal
- fix it
- use data and show us
- geting bettern and self critcal

## 12 dive deep
> [!TIP]
> tell me about the most complex project you worked on/ how you have changed an opinion or direcition using data
(shell proejct)

Leaders
- operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.
- No **task is beneath them**.

the detalis of any idea is what matters the most

## 13 Have backbone; Disagree and Commit

Leaders
- must challange decision when they disagree, even when doing so its unconfortable
- have convictions and are tenacious
- do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion
- one a descision is taken, they full commit
