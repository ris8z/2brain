# Procedural Programming
Based on the concept of *procedure calls*, where statements are structured into procedures or functions to perform tasks.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Use of *functions and procedures*
- *Top-down* design
- *Sequential execution*
- State *Mutability*
- *Separation of data and functions*
- Local and global variables
- Parameter passing

**Advantages**
1. *Modularity*: procedures allow you to break down complex problems.
2. *Code reuse*: functions can be reused across different parts of a program.
3. *Simple control flow*: programs are generally easy to understand and maintain due to sequential execution.
4. *Performance*: can be optimised for execution speed.

**Disadvantages**
1. *Difficulty in modelling real-world systems*: harder to represent complex entities and relationships.
2. *Lack of data encapsulation* : functions can access and modify global variables, potentially causing side effects.
3. *Scalability issues* : as programs grow larger, managing code becomes more difficult.
4. *Limited code reusability across systems* : code reuse is more difficult compared to object-oriented programming.
