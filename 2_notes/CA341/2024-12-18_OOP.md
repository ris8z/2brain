# Object Oriented Programming

- OOP organises software design around *objects*.

- Key principles:
  - *Abstraction* (using classes and interface)
  - *Encapsulation* (data with function, promotes data hiding)
  - *Inheritance* (use field and funcs from a superclass)
  - *Polymorphism* (use same name for multiple things)
    - inclusion (with interface)
    - parametric (with generics)

- Promotes *reusability*, *scalability*, and *maintainability*.
