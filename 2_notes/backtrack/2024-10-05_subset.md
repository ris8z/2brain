# subset

## set 
a collection of distinct objects A = {1,2,3}

## subset
a set B is a subset of A if all the elment in B are also in A
A = {1,2,3}
B = {1,2}

subset:
B ⊆ A this means that every element in B is also in A, and A and B can be the same set

proper subset:
B ⊂ A this means that every element in B is also in A, but A and B can not be the same set

## power set

is the collection of all the subsets of a set
A = {1,2,3}
P = {{},{1},{2},{1,2},{3},{1,3},{1,2,3}}


> [!TIP]
> the len of the power set is 2 ** (len(set))


## How to find the power set with recursion:

### Intution
```python3
#l = [1,2,3]
#i=  0   1  2       3                
#-----------------------
#             /----[ ]
#          [ ]
#         /   \----[3]
#       [ ]     
#      /  \   /----[2]
#     /    [2]
#    /        \----[2,3]
#   [ ]        
#    \        /----[1]
#     \    [1] 
#      \  /   \----[1,3]
#       [1]
#         \     /--[1,2]
#          [1,2]
#               \--[1,2,3]
```
### Explanation

#### Recusrive body
let n = l of i
at each node we make two descion
one add n to the current buffer
two do not add n to the current buffer
then we increase i

in this way in the one branch is going to genereate all the subset with n
and the two branch is going to generate all the subusten without n

#### Base case
when i is >= len(l), bc you already made all the descions possible

### Code
```python3
def subsets(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    result: List[List[int]] = []
    buffer: List[int] = []
    def dfs(idx: int) -> None:
        if idx >= len(nums):
            result.append(buffer.copy())
            return
        #branch with n
        buffer.append(nums[idx])
        dfs(idx + 1)

        #branch without n
        buffer.pop()
        dfs(idx + 1)
    dfs(0)
    return result

```
### Time Complexity -> O(n * (2 ** n))

bc for each elment you start a descision tree with 2 ** n time complexity
not in consideration the copy of the buffer

## How iterative?

### Intution

| set| subset1 | subset2 | subset3 | subset4 |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| [] | [] | | | |
| [1] | [] | [1] | | |
| [1,2] | [] | [1] | [2] | [1,2] |

### Explnation

for each set all its subset are just:
all the subset of the previous one + (all the subset of the previous one with the current number appended)

### Code 
```python3
def subsets(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    subsets: List[List[int]] = [[]]

    for n in nums:
        new_subsets: List[List[int]] = []
        for s in subsets:
            new_subsets.append(s + [n])
        subsets.extend(new_subsets)
    return subsets
```

### TimeComplexity Same as before
for each number u start a loop that double each time, O(n * (2 ** n))
not in consideration the copy of the buffer
