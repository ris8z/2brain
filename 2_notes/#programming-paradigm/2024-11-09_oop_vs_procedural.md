# oop_vs_procedural

why hate inerithance?

because you are inheriting over Behaior
but you are realying on inherited propetis

that why traits in rust and interface in go are really great



Composition >> inerithance


parent class shares everything by default, making them more difficult to change
while interface are minimal
