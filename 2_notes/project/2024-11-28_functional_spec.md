## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

this project goal is to create a  quadratic voting system based on a custom blockchain, it is designed to use a centralized authentication service (like estoniaid), and a decentralized mining system. to ensure a safe and clear environment for voting.

the system includes three dashboards:
- user dashboard: allows user to authenticate, view active elections, and vote using quadratic mechanism
- admin dashboard: allows administrators to create and manage elections, configure candidats, and monitor progress.
- miner dashboard: allows miners to mine directly from the browser, monitoring mining status and verify accumulated rewards

the blockchain records votes and miner-coins in blocks validated by miners. miners can start and control the mining process only from their dashboard, which evaluates the solution to the pow and sends the valid block to the blockchain. when a miner completes a pow, they get an amount x of miner-conis.

an election server (that is our representation and simplification of the estoniaid), manages centralized authentication and provides data about the elections such as candidate names, start / end dates etc. finally a centralized treasury server should convert the rewards accumulated by miners into real money or whatever the country thinks is a suitable reward.

this approach makes the system accessible, secure, and decentralized, balancing technical complexity of the block chain with a nice user-friendly interface.

### 1.2 Business Context 


this system can be utilised by european country governments such as italy, that claims to spend around 400 million euro per election. this includes costs for logistics, voting materials, personnel such as scrutineers and election officials, and also infrastructure.

if we do the maths, italy has 60 million people, let suppose that only 50 million pays taxes and votes, it is (400 / 50) = 8 euros that people pay for each election.

in general, traditional elections are resource-intensive, because they require physical assets, a manual verification process, and a lot of people. by transitioning to an online voting system, a lot of money can be saved. for instance:
- elimination of physical materials: ballots, voting booths, and other supplies.
- reduced personal costs: automation of processes like voter registration and tallying.
- simplified logistics: no need to organize physical polling stations or transport materials.

this blockchain-based system offers immutable and clear data that aligns with the requirements of a democratic system. the implementation of this system could save millions of euros per election cycle, while increasing accessibility for citizens, including those with mobility challenges.

### 1.3 Glossary

- **blockchain**: a decentralised, immutable ledger.
- **quadratic voting**: voting method that allows users to cast multiple votes with a quadratic cost increase.
- **estonian e-id system**: digital identification technology used for voter verification.
- **pow**: proof of work, a consensus mechanism.
- **miner-coins**: it is the reward for the mine that complete the pow, (this can can’t be exchanged with other users, but just with the country that decides how much it is worth)

## 2. General description

### 2.1 Product/system functions 

the system general functions are as follows:

- **User management**
  - voter auth: enables voters to use a centralised service (e.g. estoniaid) for authentication.
  - administrator access: gives admin the possibility to oversee elections, choose candidates names, and review results.
  - miner auth: provides a dashboard for miners to participate in pow and get rewards.

- **Election management**
  - election creation: admin can create elections and define candidates information.
  - election data management: stores and manages election data securely in a centralised database.

- **Voting process**
  - quadratic voting: implements quadratic voting logic, allowing voters to vote their favourite candidates, with the cost of votes increasing quadratically.
  - voter submission: submits votes to the blockchain for immutable recording.
  - real-time validation: validates votes using the blockchain.

- **Mining**
  - mining interface: provides miners their dashboard to start mine from the browser.
  - block validation: checks validity of votes and adds new blocks to the blockchain.
  - rewards system: handle the rewards for the miners.

- **Blockchain integration**
  - Immutable Record: stores a ledger of votes and transactions (miner-coins)
  - Decentralized Validation: check the integrity of the voting process
  - Reward payout: it should utilise another server (Treasury Server) that convert miner-coin into a rewards (i.e. real money)

- **Transparency and monitoring**
  - User Dashboard: allows users to see available elections and track voting history.
  - Admin Dashboard: provides tools to monitor elections in progress and check the results.
  - Miner Dashboard: shows mining activity, rewards, payment history

By using both centralized user management and decentralized blockchain validation, this system offers an efficient, secure and cheaper alternative to traditional voting.

### 2.2 User Characteristics and Objectives

### 2.4 Constraints

Below is a list of possible constraints, that the design and implementation of the system is subjected to:
- **Blockchain Processing Speed**: PoW validation may affect vote processing time.
- **Performance**: Will the system handle concurrent voting sessions efficiently.
- **Security Requirements**: Data encryption and system resilience are critical.
- **Privacy Regulations**: Compliant with privacy standards to protect voter anonymity.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: the system must meet legal requirements of the country.


## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Register/Login
*Description:* The user authenticates their identity with their digital ID. This shall be based on two-factor authentication.  
*Technical Issues:* Shall securely handle and store user credentials and encrypt all user credentials to prevent unauthorized access.

### 3.2 Quadratic Voting
*Description:* Voters submit votes with quadratic costs to balance the power of majorities and minorities. Example: Voting 3 times costs 3<sup>2</sup> = 9 credits.  
*Criticality:* Ensures fair representation while balancing majority influence with minority interest.  
*Technical Issues:* Calculation of quadratic costs correctly and real-time deduction of voter credits.

### 3.3 Election Management
*Description:* The administrators create elections and manage them by assigning unique IDs to allow multiple voting events simultaneously.  
*Technical Issues:* Avoiding conflict between elections and handling parallel events robustly.

### 3.4 Vote Casting and Authentication
*Description:* The voter securely casts the vote using the Estonian e-ID-based system.  
*Technical Issues:* Avoid unauthorized access and duplicate voting.

### 3.5 Vote Counting and Result Display
*Description:* Government dashboard is updated in real time.  
*Technical Issues:* Requires high security and speed for correct display.

### 3.6 Privacy and Security Mechanisms
*Description:* Blind signatures ensure the privacy of the voter.  
*Technical Issues:* Keeps anonymity but confirms authenticity of voter.

### 3.7 Blockchain Integration
*Description:* All votes are recorded securely on the blockchain. One block holds up to 50 votes. Blockchain verifies blocks to keep the data integrity and unchangeable.  
*Technical Issues:* Real-time block validation and seamless integration with the voting mechanism.

### 3.8 User Roles and Permissions
*Description:* The system shall have three user roles:
  - **Voters:** Can view proposals, assign votes, and submit choices.
  - **Admins:** Can create/manage voting events, add and remove proposals, and publish results.
  - **Miners:** Shall validate blocks and store transactions on the blockchain.  

*Technical Issues:* The system should use role-based access control to prevent unauthorized actions.

### 3.9 Proposal Management
*Description:* Admins can manage proposals - add, update, and remove. Proposals shall include:
- Title
- Description
- Total vote count.

### 3.10 Election Results
*Description:* The results are computed and published after the end of the election, which is the outcome of the votes stored in blockchain.  
*Technical Issues:* Computation of results correctly and transparently.

### 3.11 Incentive Mechanism for Miners
*Description:* Miners are incentivized with a Miner coin for the validation and storage of blocks.  
*Technical Issues:* Transparency in reward distribution and an auditable mechanism for the payments.

### 3.12 Data Management
*Description:* The system should store all data about voting events, proposals, votes, and blockchain transactions.  
*Technical Issues:* Data should be kept confidential but at the same time auditable.

### 3.13 Optional Features
*Real-time Progress Tracking:* Show real-time statistics of the ongoing voting (for example, votes per proposal) during an election to increase transparency.
