# symbolic vs sub symbolic AI

- **SYMBLOIC AI**
  - *Overview*
    - use symbloic reasoning
    - Knowledge is rappresented with symblos and matematical formal rules, a bit like human language
    - Logical operation are carreid out on this Knowledge in order to reach conclusion and predict about the future
    - It attempt to mantein the truth and avoid contradications, in order to produce a solution that is understandable and provaly correct.
    - Filosofia (human intelligence is rational, and can be represented by logical systems incorporating truth maintenance.)
  - *Topics*
    - AI programs for board games like chess
    - Internet Agent 
      - Semantic Web (make the data on the internet understandable for machine)
      - Data Mining (extract info from a large amount of data)
    - Planning (i.e. robot that evaluate a plan to move an object)
    - Automated Reasoning (use of logic algoritm to get new information from the current data(i.e proof a matematical teorema)
    - Expert System (used to emulate the human decisianl process in a specifc domain i.e. doctor diagnosis) 
    - Knowledege Rappresentaion (tipo prolog, a network of concept linked by reletion, i.e. a dog is an animal)

- **SUB-SYMBOLIC AI**
  - *Overview*
    - Knowledge is rappresented with numeric parameters (thousand or even millions of it) that defines:
      - Behaviour (a mapping from input senses to output action) 
      - Pattern Classification (e.g. vision, hand writing recogniction)
    - Learning through iterations
      - these parameters are modifed by a large number of iteration with the world (real of a simulation).
      - with this expereince the system becomes better. 
    - Does not worry about contradiction
    - The soultion may be hard to analyze (valutation standards are empiric)
    - Filosofia (Whatever works works in evolution, throughout evolution logic is done rarely, if at all, by most people)

  - *Topics*
    - neural networks
    - reinforcement learning
    - computational evolution/ Genetic Algorithm/ Artifical life
    - Adaptive behaviour/ Animates models/ Architecturs of the mind
