## Virualization vs Conainerisation
- *VMs* are like full virtual computers, each with its own OS. They offer strong isolation but are resource-intensive.   
- *Containers* are like lightweight packages of applications and their dependencies, sharing the host OS. They are efficient and fast but offer less isolation.   
- The choice between VMs and containers depends on the specific needs of your application. 
- If you need strong isolation and the ability to run different operating systems, VMs are a good choice.
- If you prioritize efficiency, speed, and portability, containers are a better option.
