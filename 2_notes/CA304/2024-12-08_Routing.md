# Routing

## what is it?
moving packets from one network to another

## who does it?
routers

## how?
- when reciving a packet 
- each router
  - will read the *destination ip* in the packet
  - based on its *routing table* determiate to which router or host re-send it (*nex-hop*)

## What is a routing table?
![[Pasted image 20241208171324.png]]
- a *set of entry* used to detrminate where data packets will be directed

## Default Routes
![[Pasted image 20241208172327.png]]
- define *where* packets will be sent *if no specific route* is in the routing table
- for ipv4 default route is 0.0.0.0/0

## Static Routing vs Dynamic Routing 
### how to populate the routing tables?
- **Static**
  - route tables are populated manually by network admin
- **Dynamic**
  - route tables are populated automatically 
  - using routing protocol
  - and alogrithms (distance vector, link state)

### Table confront

| **Aspect**            | **Dynamic Routing**                          | **Static Routing**                       |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Complexity**        | Generally independent of the network size    | Increases with the network size          |
| **Topology changes**  | Automatically adapts to topology changes     | Administrator intervention required      |
| **Scaling**           | Suitable for simple and complex topologies   | Suitable for simple topologies           |
| **Security**          | Less secure                                  | More secure                              |
| **Resource usage**    | Uses CPU, memory, link bandwidth             | No extra resources needed                |
| **Predictability**    | Route depends on the current topology        | Route to destination is always the same  |
