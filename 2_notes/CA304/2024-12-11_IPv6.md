# IPv6

## Need of Ipv6
- we need Ipv6 bc *we run out of Ipv4* addresses

## How Ipv6 is rappresented?
![[Pasted image 20241211212855.png]]
- with *128 bit (16 bytes)*
- we write them as a sequence of *8 blocks of 2 bytes* (called quartets)
- each block is made of *4 hex digits*
- block are separated by *:*

## How to abbreviate Ipv6
![[Pasted image 20241211215503.png]]
- *Leading 0s* in any quartets can be *removed*
- *Blocks of 0s* can be replaced with *::*

## Compare Types of Ipv6
- *Unicast* 
  - rapresents a single inteface 
  - packet are delivered to a single host
  - splitted in:
    - *Global* 2000::/3
      - addressable on the interent
    - *Link Local* fe80::/10
      - use for sending data in the local network
    - *Unique Local* ff00:/8
      - use for someone that never need to access another network
- *Anycast*
  - rapresents one or more interfaces
  - packets are forwarded to the nearest server
- *Multicast*
  - rapresents a dynamic group of hosts
  - packest are delivered to many host
- *Unspecified*
  - :: (all zero)
  - absance of an address (while you are wating for ur ip)
- *Loopback*
  - ::1
  - equivalent to 127.0.0.1 in IPv4

## Describe Ipv6 header
- *Version*: indicate the version of IP (v6)
- *Traffic Class*: equivalent to type of service in IPv4 header
- *Flow Label*: used so that all packets of the same flow receive the same type of handling by routers
- *Payload Length*: indicates the size of the data portion
- *Next Header*: equivalent to the Protocol IPv4 field
- *Hop Limit*: equivalent to TTL in IPv4 header
- *Source and Destination IPv6 addresses*

## Ipv6 vs Ipv4
| **Feature**               | **IPv6 (NDP)**                                                   | **IPv4**                                |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Discovery Protocol**    | Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) replaces ARP and ICMP router discovery | ARP and ICMP redirect                   |
| **Address Configuration** | Auto-configuration via NDP                                       | DHCP required                           |
| **Duplicate Detection**   | Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)                               | Gratuitous ARP                          |
| **Security**              | Hop limit of 255 prevents remote attacks                        | No equivalent protection                |
| **Key Messages**          | RS (133), RA (134), NS (135), NA (136), Redirect (137)          | ARP and ICMP messages                   |
| **Router Discovery**      | RS/RA for prefixes, routers, MTU                                | Static or separate protocols            |
| **MAC Resolution**        | NS/NA replaces ARP                                              | ARP                                     |
| **Path Optimization**     | Redirect messages signal better routes                         | ICMP Redirect                           |
