## Ipv4 and sub/supernetting + CIDR (ex)

## IPv6 (ex)

## Learning outcomes?

- Explain why *subnetting* is important, and how to configure subnets.
- Explain why *Ipv6* is needed, and how its *header* and *ip address* differs from *Ipv4*
- define concept of *routing*, and describe how various *routing protocols* works
- How different *wireless and cloud technologies* works.
- Why *basic security measures* are necessary.
- Understand and explain the process of *trubleshooting*
